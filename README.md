# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Ktor, and Gemini (Google's new large languagemodel).

## Features

* Displays current weather information for a given location.
* Uses Ktor for making API calls to a weather service.
* Utilizes Ktor Serialization for parsing JSON responses.
* Integrates with Gemini for natural language interactions (optional).

## Technologies Used

* Kotlin* Jetpack Compose
* Ktor
* Ktor Serialization
* Gemini (optional)
* Other relevant libraries (e.g., for location services, dependency injection)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Obtain an API key for a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual key.
4. If using Gemini, set up the necessary credentials and configuration.
5. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app.
2. Enter alocation (city name or zip code).
3. The app will display the current weather conditions for that location.
4. (Optional) Interact with the app using natural language via Gemini.
